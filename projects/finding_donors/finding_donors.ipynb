    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    " + Pratical application of Decision Trees includes: Predicting Library Book Use, Characterization of Leiomyomatous Tumors and Star/Cosmic-Ray Classification in Hubble Space Telescope Images, etc.\n",
    "  **Almuallim H, Kaneda S, Akiba Y. Development and applications of decision trees[J]. Proceedings in the Expert Systems-The Technology of Knowledge Management and Decision Making for the 21st Century Six-Volume Set, 2001: 53-77.**\n",
    " + Decision trees (and influence diagrams) have several advantages. It: \n",
    "     - Are simple to understand and interpret. People are able to understand decision tree models after a brief explanation. \n",
    "     - Have value even with little hard data. Important insights can be generated based on experts describing a situation (its alternatives, probabilities, and costs) and their preferences for outcomes. \n",
    "     - Allow the addition of new possible scenarios.\n",
    "     - The algorithm is non-parametric and can efficiently deal with large, complicated datasets without imposing a complicated parametric structure. \n",
    "     - Help determine worst, best and expected values for different scenarios.4) Use a white box model. If a given result is provided by a model. \n",
    "     - Can be combined with other decision techniques.\n",
    " + Disadvantages of decision trees:\n",
    "     - For data including categorical variables with different number of levels, information gain in decision trees is biased in favor of those attributes with more levels. \n",
    "     - Calculations can get very complex, particularly if many values are uncertain and/or if many outcomes are linked.\n",
    "     - Another major concern in decision tree construction is the risk of “overfitting” the training data.\n",

    " - When dealing with continuous data, a typical assumption is that the continuous values associated with each class are distributed according to a independent Gaussian distribution. Of course, it performs well when our data actually satisfies these two assumings well.\n",
    " - It performs poorly when our data actually do not satisfy these two assumings well. Especially, when our data features are not fully continuous i.e. some features are catogorical but transformed into dummy variables, this algorithm will perform poorly.\n",
    " - In our case, actually we do not believe this model is a good candidate for the problem. Here I wanna verify this model is not suitable for our data, because our data include a few dummy varibles which apparently do not satisfy the need of GaussianNB.\n",

    " \n",
    " * AdaBoost can achieve similar classification results with much less tweaking of parameters or settings (unless of course we choose to use SVM with AdaBoost). The user only needs to choose: (1) which weak classifier might work best to solve their given classification problem; (2) the number of boosting rounds that should be used during the training phase. And it can be less susceptible to the overfitting problem than most learning algorithms. It performs well when noisy data and outliers are less.\n",

    "1. Firstly, Adaboost achieved a considerable training accuracy up to 80% on each training dataset of the three different size , which is highly better than GaussianNB but a little lower than Decision Tree. But it doesn't matter. What we actually matter is their performance on test dataset and we can see Adaboost get the highest test performance when trained on any size of dataset. What's more, the performance of Adaboost is stable no matter what the size of test/training data is.\n",
    "2. Secondly, training time increases with the increase of the size of training data. And the training time of Adaboost is acceptable (nearly 2.5s), even though it looks like high than other two classifiers. A good aspect is that the prediction time is nearly the same for all three classifiers.\n",
    "3. Finally, all features of data is proprecessed to numeric features, which could be suitable for Adaboost."

    "1. In training stage, in our case, we first select 100 weak learners as the basic learners. At start, all data is assigned the same weight. And then the first weak learner after training will get a its discursive power *alpha* which is a function of classification error and remember which sample it made a wrong prediction. Data with wrong prediction will be passed to the second learner with a higher weight. Conversely, data with right learning will be assigned a lower weight. The second basic learner will repeat the training step as the first learner based on the adjusted weighted data. The process still proceeds to the 100th basic learner. At this time, we say, each basic learner has its own ideal on each different weighted dataset to decide each sample should belong to which classification. The next we must aggregate their ideals to one decision. In another word, let all basic learners to vote in test stage!\n",
    "2. In test stage, the *vote coefficients* depends on the discursive power *alpha* of each basic learner. That's to say, we simply do linear weighted average on all basic learners' output with *alpha* and determin the final prediction."

    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
